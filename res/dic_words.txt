Programming is the process of taking an 
algorithm and encoding it into a notation a 
programming language so that it can be executed 
by a computer Although many programming languages 
and many different types of computers exist the 
important first step is the need to have the solution 
Without an algorithm there can be no program

Computer science is not the study of programming 
Programming however is an important part of what a 
computer scientist does Programming is often the way that we create a representation for our solutions Therefore this language representation and the process of creating it becomes a fundamental part of the discipline

Algorithms describe the solution to a problem in 
terms of the data needed to represent the problem 
instance and the set of steps necessary to produce 
the intended result Programming languages must provide a 
notational way to represent both the process and the data 
To this end languages provide control constructs and data types

Control constructs allow algorithmic steps to be represented in a 
convenient yet unambiguous way At a minimum algorithms require 
constructs that perform sequential processing selection for 
decision-making and iteration for repetitive control As long as the 
language provides these basic statements it can be used for algorithm representation
